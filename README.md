# firstphasefinalproject

##### This was my final project code for the first phase at "blibli.com future program batch 4".
##### Actually, I've been presented this project on 18th January 2020. But I'm just upload it now :D
##### Thank God that I can passed the first phase.

##### p.s : you can download CentOS CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1908.iso by your own (I can't upload it here because the file size is big)
